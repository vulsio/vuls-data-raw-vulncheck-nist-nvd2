			"value": "Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. On the 2.x branch prior to versions 2.2.24 and 2.7.7, the `composer install` command running inside a git/hg repository which has specially crafted branch names can lead to command injection. This requires cloning untrusted repositories. Patches are available in version 2.2.24 for 2.2 LTS or 2.7.7 for mainline. As a workaround, avoid cloning potentially compromised repositories."

En la rama 2.x anterior a las versiones 2.2.24 y 2.7.7, el comando `composer install` que se ejecuta dentro de un repositorio git/hg que tiene nombres de rama especialmente manipulados puede provocar la inyección de comandos. Esto requiere clonar repositorios que no sean de confianza. Los parches están disponibles en la versión 2.2.24 para 2.2 LTS o 2.7.7 para la línea principal. Como workaround, evite clonar repositorios potencialmente comprometidos."
